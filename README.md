# hello-world
I'm learning how to use GitHub!

My husband is in IT but has no idea what GitHub is. Figures, since he works on databases instead of code.

Once upon a time, I took a college course in programming. The language was Pascal. I did well (for a journalism major) and got a B. Little did I know that I would be editing computer books in the future, with a particular affinity for programming books.
